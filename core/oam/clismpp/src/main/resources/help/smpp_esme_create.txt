DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to configure a new ESME.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	Name			- A unique name for this ESME configuration. You can 
				  define as many ESMEs as you want as far as the name is 
				  unique and the combination of 
				  SystemId:host-ip:port:SmppBindType is unique.

	System Id		- This is used to identify an ESME or an SMSC at bind 
				  time. An 'ESME system_id' identifies the ESME or ESME 
				  agent to the SMSC. The 'SMSC system_id' provides an 
				  identification of the SMSC to the ESME. You can define 
				  multiple ESMEs, each with a unique name but the same 
				  <literal>systemId<literal> to allow anonymous incoming
				  binds and multiple binds from the same IP depending on
				  the values specified for host-ip and port.

	host-ip	& port		- If the SMSC is acting as an ESME, the BIND request will 
				  be sent to the configured IP and Port. If the SMSC is 
				  acting as a Server, it will accept incoming BIND 
				  requests from the specified IP and Port. 
				  If the port is unknown, you must pass '-1' as wild 
				  character.

				  When you define multiple ESMEs with the same systemId,if
				  host-ip and port values are -1 (for SMPP type Server), 
				  the SMSC will accept multiple incoming BIND requests
			          from any IP:port as long as the systemId and password
				  match. 

				  When you define multiple ESMEs with the same systemId,if
				  host-ip is a real value (a specific IP) and port value 
				  is -1, the SMSC will accept as many BINDS as ESMEs 
				  defined from the specified IP but any port as long as 
				  the systemId and password match. 

	SmppBindType 		- Possible values: TRANSCEIVER, TRANSMITTER or RECEIVER. 
				  If the SMSC is acting as an ESME, it will initiate 
				  corresponding bind. If the SMSC is acting as a Server,
				  it will accept corresponding bind from a remote ESME.

	SmppSession.Type 	- Possible values: SERVER or CLIENT. 
				  If the value is 'SERVER', the SMSC acts as a Server 
				  listening for incoming SMPP binds. 
				  If the value is 'CLIENT', the SMSC will initiate 
				  SMPP bind to a remote Server.

	Optional Parameters
	
	Password		- It is used by the SMSC to authenticate the identity of 
				  the binding ESME. The Service Provider may require 
				  ESME’s to provide a password when binding to the SMSC.	

	system-type 		- Default value is null. 
				  This is used to categorize the type of ESME that is 
				  binding to the SMSC.

	interface-version	- Default value is 3.4. 

				  It is used to indicate the version of the SMPP protocol.

				  It is set in 'SMPPServer Settings'. 

	esme-ton 		- Defines ESME TON. If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this TON will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same TON as configured here. If the configured 
				  value is null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

	esme-npi 		- Defines ESME NPI. If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this NPI will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  h
