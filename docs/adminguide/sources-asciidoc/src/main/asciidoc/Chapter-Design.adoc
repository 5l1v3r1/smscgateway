= Architecture

{this-platform} {this-application} is based on robust and proven {this-platform} JAIN SLEE 1.1 Server and {this-platform} jSS7 Stack and provides easy integration with any third party communication protocol and platform. 

{this-platform} JAIN SLEE Server is a highly scalable event-driven application server with a robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment.
It provides a set of connectors to a variety of networks elements: SS7 MAP, TCAP, INAP, ISUP, SMPP, XMPP, SIP, MGCP, HTTP, XDM, XCAP, Diameter and many others.
It is fully compliant with JSR 240 (JSLEE 1.1). 

{this-platform} jSS7 is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol.
It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. {this-platform} jSS7 Stack User Guide is bundled within and you can refer to the guide for more details on the Stack. 

The diagram below depicts a high level design of {this-platform} {this-application} .


image::images/smsc-application-design-overview.png[]

{this-platform} {this-application} provides six basic services of an SMSC as shown in the figure above.
Each of these six services are implemented in the Gateway as a module that can be activated or deactivated based on the needs of an operator.
All these services interact with the Cassandra database for storing data (messages not yet sent and an archive for sent/failed to send messages) and retreiving data for messages that are pending to be sent. 

{this-platform} {this-application} can accept SMPP (incoming BIND) from ESMEs or can also initiate SMPP (outgoing BIND) to third party SMSC and hence itself acting as an ESME. {this-platform} {this-application} provides intelligent routing rules that can route SMS between various SMPP connections or between SMPP, GSM and SIP Network. 



.Service Modules
Mo (Mobile originated) module::
  Handles mobile originated SMS.

Mt (Mobile terminated)::
  Delivers SMS to mobile.

Rx SMPP module::
  Listens for incoming SMS from ESME/third party SMSC and routes them to Mt module (GSM), other ESME/third party SMSC or SIP Client depending on the routing rule.

Tx SMPP module::
  Delivers SMS to external ESME/third party SMSC received from Mo Module (GSM), ESME/third Party SMSC or SIP Client.

Rx SIP module::
  Listens for incoming SMS from SIP Client and routes them to Mt module (GSM), other ESME/third party SMSC or SIP Client depending on the routing rule.

Tx SIP module::
  Delivers SMS to SIP Client received from Mo Module (GSM), ESME/third Party SMSC or other SIP Client. |  | 

.Administration
CLI::
  {this-platform} {this-application} comes with a Command Line Interface (CLI) that provides easy to use commands to manage and monitor the SS7 Stack and the SMSC Gateway. 

Web Interface::
  {this-platform} {this-application} also includes an easy to use Web Interface administration tool that allows you to manage and monitor the Gateway via a convenient Web console. 

Campaign Tool::
  In addition, future releases will also offer a Web based campaign tool to define and manage campaigns. | 

== Database Table Structure

{this-platform} {this-application} stores messages using Cassandra database.
The database is used for storing unsent messages, messages successfully sent and messages that failed to be sent.

The {this-platform} {this-application} creates three tables for every new day with the date suffixed to the names of the tables as `DST_SLOT_TABLE_yyyy_mm_dd`, `SLOT_MESSAGES_TABLE_yyyy_mm_dd` and `MESSAGES_yyyy_mm_dd` where `yyyy_mm_dd` is the date in that format.
 

Apart from the above tables created everyday, the database also comprises of three other tables namely `CURRENT_SLOT_TABLE`, `SMPP_SMS_ROUTING_RULE` and `SIP_SMS_ROUTING_RULE` created when the SMSC is started for the first time.
The former is used for storing system-wide data and the latter two for storing the routing rules. 

=== CURRENT_SLOT_TABLE

.`CURRENT_SLOT_TABLE`
[cols="1,1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| Column Name | Data Type | Description
| ID | INT | Acts as a primary key and is unique for each entry. The value acts as an identifier of content: 0 indicates the current due slot that the SMSC processes now and 1 indicates the last assigned messageId.
| NEXT_SLOT | BIGINT | The next slot value.

[[_sms_routing_rule]]
=== SMPP_SMS_ROUTING_RULE

.`SMPP_SMS_ROUTING_RULE`

[[_db_reporting]]
=== Reporting

As of now there is no reporting in &THIS.PLATOFORM;{this-application} .
However you can leverage any external third party tool to dig Cassandra tables as defined above and create reports.
The next release of &THIS.PLATOFORM;{this-application} will feature a reporting section and also the flexibility to search for a specific SMS based on various search criteria.
